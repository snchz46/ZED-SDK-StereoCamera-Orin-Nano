# ZED-SDK-StereoCamera-Orin-Nano
This repository documents the setup, configuration, and ongoing experiments using the ZED Mini stereo camera integrated with a Jetson Orin Nano running ROS 2 Humble.
It includes notes, launch files, test scripts, and results related to real-time object detection, depth perception, and data communication between ROS 2 systems (Jetson â†” Windows).

The main goals are:

Establish a robust ZED-based perception pipeline under ROS 2.

Develop and test object detection, mapping, and spatial awareness modules.

Record and analyze datasets (rosbags) for future vision-based experiments.

Prepare for integration with autonomous UGV platforms (Waveshare or similar).

This repo serves as both a technical logbook and a development workspace for future perception and sensor-fusion tasks.
